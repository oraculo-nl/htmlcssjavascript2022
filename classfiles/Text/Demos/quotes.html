  <h1>The Declaration of Independence</h1>
  <p>The Declaration of Independence begins with the paragraph:</p>
  <blockquote
    cite="https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.html">
    <p>When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one
      people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them
      with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
      separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
      Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of
      mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
      them to the separation.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The second paragraph, which begins
  <q cite="https://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/index.html">We
  hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
  equal...</q> is more widely known.</p>
