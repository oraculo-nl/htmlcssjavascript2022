  <p>Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, 
    and began to whistle.</p>
  <p>"Don't, Jo. It's so boyish!"</p>
  <p>"That's why I do it."</p>
  <p>"I detest rude, unladylike girls!"</p>
  <p>"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!"</p>
  <p>"Birds in their little nests agree," sang Beth, the peacemaker,
    with such a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh,
    and the "pecking" ended for that time.</p>
