  The man yelled for his dog, <q><em>Come here, Snoopy!</em></q>
  When Snoopy didn't come, he yelled louder, 
  <q><strong>Get over here now, Snoopy!</strong></q>
  He had named his dog <b>Snoopy</b> after the dog in 
  <cite>Peanuts</cite>. After having called for him repeatedly,
  he finally remembered that Snoopy didn't speak English.
  He yelled, <q><dfn lang="es">Ven ac√°!</dfn></q>, which means 
  <i>Come here!</i> in Spanish.
