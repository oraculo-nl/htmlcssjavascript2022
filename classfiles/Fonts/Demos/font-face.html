  <p>When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary
    for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
    connected them with another, and to assume among the powers
    of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the
    Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them,  a decent
    respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
    declare the causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
