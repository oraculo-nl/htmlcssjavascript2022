<h3 id="alice">A MAD TEA-PARTY - Lewis Carroll</h3>
<p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and
  the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was
  sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as
  a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
  "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it's
  asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."

<h3 id="cinderella">CINDERELLA - the brothers Grimm</h3>
<p>The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end
  drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said,
  "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch
  over you." Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried
  in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and
  wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow
  spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the
  sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife.
  This new wife had two daughters of her own: they were fair in face but
  foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl.
  "What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlor?" said they;
  and they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put
  on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen.

<h3 id="naughtyboy">THE NAUGHTY BOY - Hans Christian Andersen</h3>
<p>Along time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old
  poet. As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm
  arose without, and the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old
  poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire
  blazed and the roasting apple hissed.
