    <h2>A MAD TEA-PARTY - Lewis Carroll</h2>
    <img src="images/alice-and-wonderland.jpg" alt="Alice and Wonderland">
    <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and
      the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was
      sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as
      a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head.
      "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice; "only, as it's
      asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."

    <h2>CINDERELLA - the brothers Grimm</h2>
    <img src="images/cinderella.jpg" alt="Cinderella">
    <p>The wife of a rich man fell sick: and when she felt that her end
      drew nigh, she called her only daughter to her bedside, and said,
      "Always be a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch
      over you." Soon afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried
      in the garden; and the little girl went every day to her grave and
      wept, and was always good and kind to all about her. And the snow
      spread a beautiful white covering over the grave; but by the time the
      sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife.
      This new wife had two daughters of her own: they were fair in face but
      foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time for the poor little girl.
      "What does the good-for-nothing thing want in the parlor?" said they;
      and they took away her fine clothes, and gave her an old frock to put
      on, and laughed at her and turned her into the kitchen.

    <img src="images/cupid.jpg" alt="Cupid">
    <p>Along time ago, there lived an old poet, a thoroughly kind old
      poet. As he was sitting one evening in his room, a dreadful storm
      arose without, and the rain streamed down from heaven; but the old
      poet sat warm and comfortable in his chimney-corner, where the fire
      blazed and the roasting apple hissed.
